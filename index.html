                <ul class = "highlights-dropdown">
					

                  <li><b>May start as a way to socially connect</b>Sometimes teens tries to look cool in front of their friends or they think they can easily make friends by taking drugs. 
	They feel that their strong desire of fitting into group can only be accomplished by doing the drugs
				  
				  </li>
                  <li><b>Problems can sometimes sneak up on you:</b> Sometimes teens think if they take the drugs (for pleasure) once in every month then they they are not gonna addicted to it.
 Then they make it once in a week. Gradually, by decreasing the time period from drug dose to another they get themselves in addiction of drugs</li>
                  <li>Does the drug fulfill a valuable need eens take drugs to calm and energize them. Energy that they require in sports. Which is quite bad because energy comes naturally by time to time. You can not boost it up quickly by going against the nature. The situation could become worse when you are not taking drugs because when you don’t
 have that kind of energy now. This leads to the addiction. </li>
                  <li><b>As drug abuse takes hold</b> Teens could miss or frequently be late for work and may start to neglect their social and family responsibilities. Their ability to stop using the drugs is eventually compromised. What began as a voluntary
 choice has turned into a physical and psychological need.</li>
<li><b>Can consume your life,</b> stopping social and intellectual development. This only reinforces the feelings of isolation that led to the drug use in the first place.</li>

                <h2>Teens Dealing Drugs</h2>
                <ul class = "highlights-dropdown">
                  <li>The main reason teens deal drugs because adults use them as proxies. If an adult is caught dealing drugs then its a very big deal for them they will have to go to the prison for almost 10-15 years but, for children it is 1-2 years in juvie. So adults either threaten them or accuse them to deal drugs. </li>
                  <li>Not only is this resulting into jail sentences and a life-long criminal record on the teens behalf but also causing gang violence and shootouts in our community. </li>

                <h2>Jaw dropping Statistics </h2>
                <ul class = "highlights-dropdown">
                  <li>A report was posted by Canadian government (posted date: September 7, 2017) on the topic of Illicit Drug Overdose death in BC. The report give data about substance abuse in BC between January 1, 2007 to July 31, 2017. Following were the main points 
				  that the report brought into light, in regards to drug use in BC:</li>
				  <li>Drug overdose deaths in 2017 has increased by 30% as compared to last year’s death toll. There were 70 cases 
				  of drug overdose by July 2016 and 91 cases by the end of July 2017.</li>
                  <li>Highest drug overdoses to date were recorded in Victoria, Surrey and Vancouver.  
				  Surrey and Vancouver being 40 km and 70 Km away from Abbotsford respectively.</li>
				  <li> The approx. ratio between men and women having drug overdose issue is 4 : 1. Men are more likely to face drug abuse as compared to women.</li>
				  <li>More than half of the places of injury are at descends Private residence. Other half includes public buildings, hotels, streets, outdoors etc.</li>
				  <li>      Cocaine is the most frequently used drug that cause deaths in BC. About half of the deaths in 2015-2016 was due to cocaine or combination of cocaine and other drugs. Fentanyl is the second most frequent cause of drug abuse.</li>
				  <li> Percentage of teenagers who lost their lives by drug overdose were 23% - 30% of the total cases. This percentage has remained in the range of 23%-30% since 2007.</li>
                  <li>Even though there has been no significant increase in teenager’s death toll in past 10 years, there is still a big percentile of teenagers who are affected by drug abuse. These casualties can be avoided by proper education of teens regarding drug addiction and its side effects.
